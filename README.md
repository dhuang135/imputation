# imputation
An Imputation Package in R. This is currently a *WORK IN PROGRESS*. As such, any help/debugging would be greatly appreciated. 

Functions:
1) KNNimpute: applies K-Nearest Neighbors to impute missing values. Works with both categorical and numeric data. Still refining the methodology and edge cases.
